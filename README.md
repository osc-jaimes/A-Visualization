# A* Search Algorithm Visualization
A P5.js implementation to visualize the A* path finding algorithm.

## Introduction
The A* Search Algorithm is a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm which is a graph traversal
and path search algorithm. A* is a best-first search algorithm which means the algorithm explores
a weighted graph by expanding the best valued node chosen according to a pre-determined function
that outputs a certain cost for the node in order to reach the goal node in the graph.



## How to run the visualization:
Drag the index.html file into a web browser for the program to run.
Note that this program has only been tested on Google Chrome.

The P5.js library is included in this repository, as it is needed for the visualization to run.
If it does not work, one can download the P5.js library from <https://p5js.org/download/> and drag
all the.js files in the repository into the sample project folder.

## Controling The Program:
1. To add a start node: 's' + left click
2. To add an end node: 'e' + left click
3. To add a wall: left click
4. To clear any node: right click
